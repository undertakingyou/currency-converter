# Currency Convertor sample app
Simple quick app to do currency conversions. This sample must have the following features:
* Input for US Dollar Amount
* Input for target currency code
* Button to submit
* Call api for currency conversion
* Store the conversion in the DB
* Show results from the DB

This uses the following things:
* sqlite
* Next JS
* Extra Libraries:
  * @tanstack/react-query
  * react-hook-form

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Note: port will autoassign if 3000 is in use.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
